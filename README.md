# Investigating the Correlation Between Daily Social Media Usage and Sleep Time in Graduate, Undergraduate, and Highschool Students

## Introduction
In recent years, the ever-increasing use of social media has raised growing concerns regarding mental health, sleep patterns and its addictive nature. Students, in particular, make up the largest demographic on many social media platforms and thus also suffer the most from their harmful side effects. During the formative years of high school students, mental health, restful sleep and self regulation are especially important, as they often have lasting impacts into adulthood. 

This project investigates the relationship between the time spent on social media on a daily basis and sleep duration among high school, undergraduate and graduate students. By means of analyzing survey data, the project aims to determine if high social media usage is associated with reduced sleep time and how this relationship manifests itself differently across academic levels. The purpose of this study is to inform students, teachers and professors, as well as policy makers about the possible harmful effects of excessive social media usage on student's well-being and academic success.

## Conclusion
In this project, the relationship between social media usage and sleep time among students at differing academic levels has been investigated. By means of descriptive statistics, regression analysis and clustering methods, several insight have been gained:
* **Use of social media differs significantly across academic levels, with high schools students reporting the highest addiction scores**
* **Addiction scores and sleep time per night are negatively correlated, suggesting that excessive social media use is connected to less sleep duration**
* **Machine Learning models such as regression analysis provided a limited predictive power. This shows that sleep time may be impacted by other factors beyond social media use**
* **Unsupervised clustering has found 18 distinct student profiles, which can be further analyzed in future investigations**
